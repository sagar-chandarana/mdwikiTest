# Hack Night - Build realtime systems

Appbase is building a Twilio for databases. We offer real-time, searchable, graph DB APIs accessible via Javascript and REST. 
The idea is to build something demoable in a short time frame (2-3 hours), and collaborate with fellow hackers. The format is intentionally open, so we don't leave out any good ideas. 
We will have food and drinks to go along.

Timeline: 
5:30pm Doors open, networking 
6:15pm Talks (2 lightning demos, and 1 talk) 
6:45pm Hack time! 
9:15pm Presentations: Show off what you have made


FAQs

Q. Tools / technologies that are allowed 
A. You can use anything. Of course, we would love if you try out the Appbase APIs and we have some prizes for that.

Q. Is there a structure for the hackathon? 
A. It's meant to be informal. You can work together with others, or go on your own.

PS: We have some surprise prizes.
